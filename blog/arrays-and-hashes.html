        <h3>Arrays and Hashes</h3>
        <time datetime="2016-03-06">March 6, 2016</time>
        <p>Arrays and hashes are Ruby methods used to organize information into collections in a way that allows it to be easily accessed when it is later called upon.
        </p>
        <h4>Arrays</h4>
        <p>Arrays are ordered collections of objects, starting with [0]. They're ordered because they have a numerical index- if the array has five objects and you call on the fourth object in that array, it will know which object you mean.
        </p>
        <p>Arrays are easy to use, and they can store any object. That includes strings, integers, floats, but they can also store other arrays, hashes, classes, anything.
        </p>
        <h4>Hashes</h4>
        <p>
        Hashes are similar to arrays in that they store collections of objects. More recent versions of Ruby this is an ordered collection, though previously they were totally unordered.
        </p>
        <p>What makes hashes majorly different from arrays is the they store objects in pairs, called the key and the value. Any object can be a key or value, but their can only be one key/value pair for any key. It's like a lock: only one key can be used to open the door to the value. If the key could open multiple doors it could cause a lot of trouble when the key was called on. If a key/value pair was cat/Zeus, and I could also make a key/value pair cat/Zephyr, how would the program know what to return when I asked for a specific cat? It's better to make a more specific key per cat, such as persian_cat/Zeus and tabby_cat/Zephyr.
