        <h3>What is Rails?</h3>

          <p>Ruby on Rails, also known as Rails, is an open source web application framework written in Ruby. It’s designed to make programming web applications easier while using a minimal amount of code; the framework includes assumptions of what every developer will need, reducing the amount of ground-up writing the developer will need to do.</p>

          <p>One of the guiding principles is <b>Convention Over Configuration</b>.  There are a set of conventions that ease the developers jobs by not requiring them to specify everything through configuration files. There are some limitations to this; Rails assumes there is a “best” way to accomplish things, and if the programmer ignores these conventions they’ll have difficulty. But if they embrace it the app development process is optimized and sped up.</p>

          <p>The other principle is <b>Don’t Repeat Yourself</b>. Optimal code isn’t repetitive, and is written clearly to be more maintainable, less buggy, and more easy to develop more at later dates.</p>

          <p>Many popular applications are built with Rails. A small sample of these include GitHub, Airbnb, and Hulu, demonstrating the ways Rails can be applied.</p>
