        <h3>Margins and Borders and Padding (the tasty version)</h3>
        <time datetime="2016-02-28">February, 28 2016</time>

        <p>When you make a box in CSS, whether it’s a button or a block of text or a header or a footer, it has different components. The object itself is the content, but what around it makes up the padding, the border, the margin?</p>

        <p>I ordered a pizza while contemplating this topic (this was after several hours of fiddling around with CSS). While chomping into my first slice, kind of absently thought to myself, “This pizza looks a lot like a div box”. It’s probably important to note that this pizza was square, and also that I ate it before I took a picture, so here’s an artistic rendition of what it looked like:</p>

        <p><img id="inblog" src="../imgs/pizza.png" alt="git commit -m Eating the div box"></p>

        <p>Here’s a diagram of a box and what surrounds it that you can manipulate in CSS to compare:</p>

        <p><img id="inblog" src="../imgs/margin-padding-content.png" alt="Less delicious"></p>

        <p><b>Content</b>: Let’s start at the center. In my pizza’s case, that content is the cheese and the toppings. The most important part of a pizza, but also the part that everyone is looking at to get the info from. Let’s imagine that my content is a section, full of lots of elements full of information. Those are all the toppings, and it’s why the pizza is interesting.</p>

        <p><b>Padding</b>: Padding is the spacing between the content and the border. The crust is my pizza’s padding. Padding won’t show if you don’t have a background color set, but it’s important to remember that it will be included within the <b>border</b> (in this case, the burnt edges of the pizza that I didn’t draw in). It can be adjusted in CSS to move the border closer to or farther from the content (or the pizza chef could stretch the dough out more or less).</p>

        <p><b>Margin</b>: Finally, the margin is the space around the element. The larger the margin, the more space between the element and the elements around it. In a pizza’s case, the box is the margin. Put a pizza in a bigger box and it increases the space between that pizza and another pizza without actually increasing the pizza’s size.
