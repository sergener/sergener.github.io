        <h3>Ruby Classes</h3>
        <time datetime="2016-03-20">March 20, 2016</time>

        <p>Ruby is an object-based programming language. What is a class in Ruby?</p>

        <p>For example, let's define the class <b>Cat</b>. Here's my cat, Zeus, looking more suave than he really is:</p>

        <p><img id="inblog" src="../imgs/zeus.png" alt="Zeus!"></p>

        <p>He has certain attributes every cat does, which I'm going to define as instance variables in the method initialize. They're instance variables for a reason: instance variables are accessible in every method through the entire class, and I want all this info about Zeus to be accessible throughout all of <b>Cat</b>! He has a name(Zeus), color(white), a high-pitched meow(MOW!).</p>

        <p>He also has a bunch of normal cat behaviors that I can create in the <b>Cat</b> class. He likes to eat, the way most cats do, he grooms himself, he likes to cuddle. I can define how <i>much</i> he likes to cuddle in an instance variable and then call it the method, which will be the actual action of that behavior.</p>

        <p>Here's what this class will look like in Ruby. See if you can spot all the things I just explained!</p>

        <p><img id="inblog" src="../imgs/zeusclass.png" alt="Zeus!"></p>

        <p>I created a new zeus class after I finished writing the class, including all the info I wanted to make variables of as arguments to the class. I then called the specific method in the class, .cuddle. Here's what was printed to my console!:

        <p><img id="inblog" src="../imgs/zeusreturn.png" alt="Zeus likes to cuddle"></p>

        <p>So that's all great! BUT WAIT! I have another cat, Zephyr! What about him?</p>

        <p><img id="inblog" src="../imgs/zephyr.png" alt="Zephyr!"></p>

        <p>Luckily, I have my class all ready to take information on another similar but different cat. I can just load up some new info into the arguments on a new instance of this class.</p>

        <p><img id="inblog" src="../imgs/zephyrclass.png" alt="Zephyr's turn"></p>

        <p>And then when I want to see how much Zephyr likes to cuddle...:</p>

        <p><img id="inblog" src="../imgs/zephyrreturn.png" alt="Zephyr likes cuddling the most!"></p>

        <p>These classes can be much more complicated and do many more things and hold much more information, but this shows the basic idea of how they work. Now to go add even more info about my cats!</p>
