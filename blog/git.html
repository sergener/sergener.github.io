    <h2>The basics of git</h2>

        So, why use git? I’m on a Mac, with its user friendly interface and it’s pretty easy to open finder and just click on files when I need them. SWhy use the terminal on my computer and have to manually type things out to pull up directories and files instead? .

          Like in anything, taking something apart and learning how it works on a fundamental level makes understanding everything so much easier. It’s a similar concept to how an artist will study a skeleton when learning to figure draw, or how learning Latin roots helps a linguist understand English- everything just makes more sense when you know how things work inside.

          As I learn to program, it’s essential to understand how computers work on a fundamental level. Even if I wasn’t, though, why not learn a little bit about Unix? Like everyone, I’ve been painfully frustrated when I’ve lost files, or accidentally renamed them something silly.  Using git and version control is a good way to have a better understanding of where these files live as well as how to understand how you can manipulate them in more basic ways.
          </p>

          <h4>Wait, what’s version control? </h4>
          </p>
           <p>
           Version control allows the user to view the entire history of revisions made to one or more files. Those revisions are logged and include the name and email of the person who made the change, a timestamp, and a message. It’s possible to see the history of changes as well as a clear line of messages that describe those changes and easily roll back the document, software, or program.
        </p>
      <p>
        Developers use version control because it allows them to keep track of changes and the evolution of a project. If a bug or glitch is found, they can then more easily find when it was implemented and be able to fix it. The saved changes to code are called commits. The developer will make changes to a repository by adding or staging the folder or file, and then save the changes to the repository with the commit.
      </p>
      <p>

        <h4> That sounds cool, but how do I use it? </h4>
      </p>
      <p>
        Git is software that equips file folders in comp with version control. Any individual folder on a comp can be a Git repository; repositories shouldn’t exist within one another, and large folders like a desktop should not be a repository.
      </p>
      <p>

      Want to store this information elsewhere as well? GitHub is a popular cloud repository storage service, which means that Git repositories can be saved online. GitHub also provides an easily browsable history of changes and allows a user to share code with other developers.  For code that multiple developers may be working on, GitHub is especially valuable in that it allows them to easily work on the same project.
      </p>

      They can view, fork, and pull that code to store it to their local computers. Forking, or copying it, means they can either work on the same project with the original developer by pushing their changes back to the master, or use the code in a totally new way without doing anything to the original. If they make branches of the original program, they can also work on code without having to commit it back to the master code until it is finalized, allowing the master code to remain polished while the developers figure out the best way to implement new code.
