<!--
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was really useful to wireframe as a pair. It's very easy to get lost in an idea or have trouble focusing on eactly how to realize a thought, so talking through the wireframing processa was good. Having someone who was working on the same project was nice because we could discuss our sometimes divergent ideas and figure out a good middleground to make each of our ideas be, hopefully, more successful as we continue to learn HTML and CSS.
As I'm still new to HTML, it was very helpful to have someone work with me to help me figure out the concepts but also to be able to confirm that I understood what I'd learned correctly. 

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
I think it was very helpful to have a visual to aid in the development process. I'm a visual person, so being able to look at an image and see what, exactly, comes next in the coding process made writing the HTML framework go more quickly.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
We agreed that simple is better for a wireframe, though we also agreed that making things simple is often a deceptively difficult task. We made sure to focus on not losing sight of what the main purpose of the page was - in this case the blog page - and we made sure that in the process of wireframing we didn't overwhelm the visual prominence of the blog post.


What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
Both of us are new to HTML5 so it was helpful to be able to discuss the different uses of section, article, aside, and nav. I still have trouble completely getting when it's more apporpriate to use one than another, but I think it helped the idea of what each does get a foothold in my mind. I also learned main, which I hadn't used before but was helpful.
